			<p>A popular urban legend claims that bars frequently contain large mirrors in order to stimulate self-awareness and prevent intoxicated, aggressive behavior. Could a similar effect be achieved in online environments?</p>

			<p>A brief literature review suggests that that self-awareness can reduce aggressive behavior aimed towards the self and towards others. Two types of self-awareness are relevant: with private, self-focused attention encourages reflection on one's own attitudes, standards, and emotional states. In some studies, private self-awareness is induced with the presence of mirrors and live video feeds of onself.  Public self-awareness, on the other hand, can be induced with the presence of cameras or other people, and is typically concerned with notions of accountability and extrinsic social standards.</p>

If the browser and the timeline or stream are primary interfaces for viewing and interacting with the world, these interfaces present opportunities for high-leverage interventions that facilitate positive feedback loops.</p>
